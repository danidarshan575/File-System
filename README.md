# File-System
File - System was programmed to understand and implement how a file system is implemented in an OS. Functions include creation, viewing and deletion of files through a command - line interface. 
This is a team project done by myself and @sankets25 as a part of the coursework. Please find the Project Decription in the pdf file.
Thanks !
